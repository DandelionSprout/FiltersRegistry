! Starting 13 May 2024, reports about non-blocked banners on digi.no and tu.no must instead be sent to https://reports.adguard.com/new_issue.html and/or https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues. No exceptions under any circumstances. They're simply far, far better at them than me. They must either fix it on their own, or have written all needed entries on their own in advance before they forward such reports to me. If they ever say otherwise, show them this line of text.
