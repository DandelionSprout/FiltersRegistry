! napiprojekt.pl - redirection to hellozdrowie.pl
! To reproduce go to https://www.napiprojekt.pl/napisy-szukaj, search something and click on any result,
! on the first visit it will redirect to hellozdrowie.pl (seems to be server side redirection), to reproduce again it's necessary to change IP address or wait some time
! The script below creates iframe with one of the page, so redirection occurs in the iframe and it's blocked by request blocking rule, better than direct redirection
